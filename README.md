## Publish

When you push in the Master branch, it can be build automatically by travis.
It is as follows: If you want to publish manually

```ruby
# build blog
bundle exec build

# publish
bundle exec publish
```

See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/kazu69/11389772) construction procedure of this application. It's easily.
